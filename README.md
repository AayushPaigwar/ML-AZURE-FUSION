# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of samples of mushrooms, where each sample is characterized by the following input features:
- Gill Size
- Gill Color
- Stalk Root
- Spore Print Color
- Population

The target variable is the classification of the mushroom as either **"edible"** or **"poisonous"**.



# Model

The decision tree algorithm was chosen for this classification task.


# Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Install required libraries:
<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
2. Run the app:
<code>flask run</code>
